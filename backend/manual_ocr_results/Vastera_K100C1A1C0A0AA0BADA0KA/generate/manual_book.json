          "Cold Exposure Risks<br/>Cold shock response decreases with exposure experience. Hypothermia is a risk—it can lead to loss of consciousness and heart failure. Duration in cold water depends on factors like temperature, body size, and experience. Consult your doctor. Start with brief dips to find limits. Exit if uncomfortable.",
