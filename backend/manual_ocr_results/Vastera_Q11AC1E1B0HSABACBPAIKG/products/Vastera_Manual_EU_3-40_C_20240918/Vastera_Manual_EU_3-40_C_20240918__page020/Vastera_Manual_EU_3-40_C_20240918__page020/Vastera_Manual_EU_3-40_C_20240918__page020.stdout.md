## Thermo Protection Activation  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[83, 194, 808, 231]]<|/det|>
Your cold plunge unit is equipped with an advanced thermo protection feature designed to safeguard the equipment and ensure its longevity.  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[85, 250, 299, 266]]<|/det|>
## Activation Threshold:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[110, 272, 904, 306]]<|/det|>
The thermo protection mode is activated when the unit is exposed to temperatures exceeding \(43^{\circ}C\) \((110^{\circ}F)\)  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[85, 323, 395, 339]]<|/det|>
## Thermo Protection Mode (ER 20):  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[115, 345, 900, 416]]<|/det|>
When activated, the unit will display the error code ER 20, indicating that the thermo protection mode is engaged. This mode is a protective measure to prevent potential damage to the unit caused by excessive temperatures.  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[85, 433, 460, 450]]<|/det|>
## Functionality During Thermo Protection:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[115, 455, 920, 529]]<|/det|>
While in thermo protection mode, the unit will temporarily halt its normal functions to protect internal components. This pause in operation helps to prolong the lifespan of your cold plunge unit and reduce the need for maintenance.  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[85, 545, 400, 561]]<|/det|>
## Restoration of Normal Operation:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[115, 567, 897, 621]]<|/det|>
The unit will automatically return to normal functioning once the temperature drops below the activation threshold of \(43^{\circ}C\) \((110^{\circ}F)\) . No additional user action is required for the unit to resume normal operation.  

<|ref|>sub_title<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 679, 235, 695]]<|/det|>
## Maintenance Tips:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[80, 701, 866, 773]]<|/det|>
Ensure that your cold plunge unit is placed in an environment where temperatures are regularly monitored to prevent frequent activation of the thermo protection mode. Regularly inspect and maintain the unit as per the guidelines in the maintenance section of this manual to enhance its durability and performance.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[83, 797, 788, 811]]<|/det|>
By following these guidelines, you can ensure optimal performance and a longer lifespan for your cold plunge unit.
