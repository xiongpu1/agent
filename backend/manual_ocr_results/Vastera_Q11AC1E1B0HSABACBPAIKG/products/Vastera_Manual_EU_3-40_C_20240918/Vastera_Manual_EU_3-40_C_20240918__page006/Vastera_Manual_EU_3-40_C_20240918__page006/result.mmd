## How To Set Up  


## If you're excited to reap the benefits of your new Vinterköld, start by following these simple guidelines to embark on your journey.  


We understand your enthusiasm, but we strongly recommend reading the entire instruction manual, paying special attention to the safety information, before beginning your cold therapy sessions with the Vinterköld. Your safety and maximum enjoyment are our top priorities.  


1 Place your Vinterköld in a suitable location and fill it with water to tub until the water level reaches the recommended mark as specified.  


2 Open the air bleed screw to exhaust air from the filter and pump housing. See page 11 for more details.  


3 Plug the cold tub into a 220- 240V/50 Hz power source and set the desired temperature using the control panel.  


4 Within a few hours, you can enjoy the refreshing experience of cold water therapy.  


5 We highly recommend regularly cleaning and sanitizing.
