<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[140, 552, 904, 758]]<|/det|>
- Connect the power supply and activate the control panel to start the equipment.- Allow the equipment to operate for 20-30 seconds. Then, bleed the filter for 20-40 seconds by opening the bleeder valve on one side of the filter cover (refer to the figure). When water flows out from the filter vent, tighten the filter approximately 5-10 seconds after water appears.- Completing these steps will ensure the circulation pump operates at its peak performance.- If the control panel indicates that the circulation pump is functioning normally but there is no water circulation in the pipeline, please repeat steps 1 and 2. (This is a rare occurrence)
