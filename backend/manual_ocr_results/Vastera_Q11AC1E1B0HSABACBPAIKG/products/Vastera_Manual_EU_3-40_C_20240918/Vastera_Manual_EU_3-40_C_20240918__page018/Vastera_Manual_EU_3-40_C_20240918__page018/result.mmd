Efficiently draining your Vinterkold.  


## Condensate Drainage.  


The condensation drain is a crucial component of your unit's maintenance. During the cooling process, condensation occurs, producing excess water that needs to be properly managed. This water is directed into the drain, which either leads to an area away from the unit or into a container for later removal.  


## LOCATE THE CONDENSATION DRAIN HOOKUP  


Find the condensation drain hookup near the bottom of the unit. Refer to the provided picture for exact placement.
