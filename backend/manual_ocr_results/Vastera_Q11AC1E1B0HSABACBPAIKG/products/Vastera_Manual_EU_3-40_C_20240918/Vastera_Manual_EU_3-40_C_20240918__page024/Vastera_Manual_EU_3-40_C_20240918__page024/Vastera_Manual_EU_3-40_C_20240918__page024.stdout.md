- Spa may be in high-temperature range. Set the spa to low-temperature range.- The filter may be dirty or need to be replaced. Clean or replace the filter.- The pump may have an airlock. Remove the airlock by priming the spa.- The water level may be too low. Fill the spa until the water level is 4 to 6 inches from the top.- The suction fittings may be blocked. Remove any debris that may be blocking them.- The temperature may not be set low enough. Lower the temperature on the topside control.- The filter skimmer may be blocked. Remove the blockage.- Cover the spa to retain its warmth and prevent cold from penetrating. Ensure the cover is in place whenever the spa is not in use.- Gate valves may be closed. Open gate valves. Note: Never operate your spa with closed gate valves.- The cooling element may be old, defective, or coated with scale. For further assistance, please contact your dealer.- Spa may be running in heating mode.

Bad smell  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[360, 753, 883, 808]]<|/det|>

The temperature differs from what the termometer shows  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[360, 839, 830, 870]]<|/det|>
The internal temperature probe is calibrated to within \(0.3 \text{o} + / - \) There could be an issue with the temperature sensor or PCB board.
