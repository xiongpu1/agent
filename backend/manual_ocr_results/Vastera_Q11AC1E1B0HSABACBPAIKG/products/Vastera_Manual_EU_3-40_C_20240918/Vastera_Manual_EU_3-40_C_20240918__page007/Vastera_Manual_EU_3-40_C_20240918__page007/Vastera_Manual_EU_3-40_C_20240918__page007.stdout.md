## Temperature Awareness  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 319, 744, 335]]<|/det|>
Start with a higher temperature (15°C / 59°F) and a shorter duration (1- 2 minutes).

## Gradual Adaptation  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 374, 864, 424]]<|/det|>
Tolerance to cold water varies. Gradually increase Vinterkold usage time. Sudden immersion can shock the body; enter slowly, keeping face, shoulders, and hands above water until breathing is steady.

## Cold Exposure Risks  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 463, 877, 513]]<|/det|>
Cold shock response decreases with exposure experience. Hypothermia is a risk - it leads to loss of consciousness and heart failure. Duration in cold water depends on factors like temperature, body size, and experience. Consult your doctor. Start with brief dips to find limits. Exit if uncomfortable.
