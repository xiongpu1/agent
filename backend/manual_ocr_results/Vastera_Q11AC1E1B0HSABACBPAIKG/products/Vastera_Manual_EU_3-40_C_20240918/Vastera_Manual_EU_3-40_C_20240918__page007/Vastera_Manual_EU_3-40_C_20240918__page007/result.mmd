## READ AND FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS  


Taking the plunge is a significant step, and Bellagio Spas disclaims all liability for damages due to failure to follow the provided guidelines.  


## Health Disclaimer  


If unsure, consult your doctor before using the Vinterkold. While generally suitable for most individuals, those with reduced mobility or sensory/cognitive abilities should use the Vinterkold under supervision and only if knowledgeable about safe usage and potential risks.  


## Temperature Awareness  


Start with a higher temperature (15°C / 59°F) and a shorter duration (1- 2 minutes).  


## Gradual Adaptation  


Tolerance to cold water varies. Gradually increase Vinterkold usage time. Sudden immersion can shock the body; enter slowly, keeping face, shoulders, and hands above water until breathing is steady.  


## Cold Exposure Risks  


Cold shock response decreases with exposure experience. Hypothermia is a risk - it leads to loss of consciousness and heart failure. Duration in cold water depends on factors like temperature, body size, and experience. Consult your doctor. Start with brief dips to find limits. Exit if uncomfortable.  


## Safety Precautions  


- Supervise children around the Vinterkold.- Pregnant women, children, and those with medical conditions must consult a doctor before using.- Avoid alcohol or drugs before use.- Do not use in extreme weather or flood conditions.- Ensure proper drainage to avoid water accumulation.  


## Maintenance  


- Be cautious when entering and exiting the Vinterkold.- Keep the inlet clean to protect the pump.- Avoid using electrical appliances nearby when empty.- Use only approved cleaning agents; rinse thoroughly.- Do not pressure wash the Vinterkold.- Keep the cover on to prevent injuries and water ingress.- For repairs, consult Vinterkold's approved engineers.  


## Power Supply Safety  


Ensure the power supply is on an GFCI protected circuit for safety.
