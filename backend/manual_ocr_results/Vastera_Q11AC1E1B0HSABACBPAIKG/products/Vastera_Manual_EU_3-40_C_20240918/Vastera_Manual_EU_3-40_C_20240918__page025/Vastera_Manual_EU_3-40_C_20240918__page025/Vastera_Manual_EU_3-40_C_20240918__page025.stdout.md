## Start-up problem  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 264, 228, 278]]<|/det|>
Pump won't prime  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[363, 206, 860, 268]]<|/det|>
Sometimes air may get trapped in the pump during spa filling. You may notice that after filling and starting the spa, the pump appears to be non- functional. You can hear the pump running, but there's no water movement.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[364, 275, 831, 315]]<|/det|>
The pump will not work properly while air is trapped in it. Continuing to operate the pump in this way will cause damage.

## Power and system problems  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 394, 281, 424]]<|/det|>
System won't start up or breaker keeps shutting off  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[364, 394, 877, 424]]<|/det|>
Power may be shut off. If this continues, contact your dealer or a qualified spa technician.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 455, 319, 500]]<|/det|>
Communication problem between the control mainframe and the circulation pump.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[364, 455, 876, 500]]<|/det|>
Please check the connecting wire between the control main unit and the heat pump and replace it if necessary. Or please check if the heat pump is powered.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[95, 531, 310, 576]]<|/det|>
The control panel cannot communicate with the control mainframe  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[364, 531, 885, 562]]<|/det|>
Check the connecting wire between the control panel and the control main unit. Replace if necessary.
