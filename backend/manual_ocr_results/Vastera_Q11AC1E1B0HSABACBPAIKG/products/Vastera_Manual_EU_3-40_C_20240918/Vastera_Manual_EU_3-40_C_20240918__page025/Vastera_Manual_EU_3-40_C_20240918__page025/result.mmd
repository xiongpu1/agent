# Possible Solutions  


## Start-up problem  


Pump won't prime  


Sometimes air may get trapped in the pump during spa filling. You may notice that after filling and starting the spa, the pump appears to be non- functional. You can hear the pump running, but there's no water movement.  


The pump will not work properly while air is trapped in it. Continuing to operate the pump in this way will cause damage.  


## Power and system problems  


System won't start up or breaker keeps shutting off  


Power may be shut off. If this continues, contact your dealer or a qualified spa technician.  


Communication problem between the control mainframe and the circulation pump.  


Please check the connecting wire between the control main unit and the heat pump and replace it if necessary. Or please check if the heat pump is powered.  


The control panel cannot communicate with the control mainframe  


Check the connecting wire between the control panel and the control main unit. Replace if necessary.
