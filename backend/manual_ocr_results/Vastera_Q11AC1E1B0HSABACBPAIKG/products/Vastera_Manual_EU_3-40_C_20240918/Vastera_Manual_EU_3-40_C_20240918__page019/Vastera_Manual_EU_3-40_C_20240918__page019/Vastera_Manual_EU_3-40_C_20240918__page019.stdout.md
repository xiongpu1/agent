## DIRECT THE DRAIN LINE  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[130, 557, 520, 574]]<|/det|>
You have two options for directing the drain line:  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[150, 580, 912, 654]]<|/det|>
- To an Area with Proper Draining: Ensure that the water is directed to a suitable drainage area to prevent any water accumulation near the unit.- To a Container: Position a container to catch the water. Ensure that this container is emptied regularly or as needed to avoid overflow.

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[130, 876, 893, 904]]<|/det|>
SAFETY PRECAUTIONS: Be aware that surfaces around the unit may become slippery when wet. Take appropriate measures to ensure safety by keeping the area dry and using non-slip mats if necessary.  

<|ref|>text<|/ref|><|det|>[[135, 916, 905, 943]]<|/det|>
- By following these steps, you will effectively manage the condensation produced by your unit, ensuring optimal performance and maintenance.
